<p align="justify">
The "Code Editor" repository contains code for a web application that allows users to write, edit, and test code in real-time. The application is similar to popular code editors like CodePen and JSFiddle, and offers a range of features for developers and designers alike.<br><br>
The code in the repository is written primarily in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and uses a range of front-end tools and libraries to provide a rich and responsive user interface. Some of the tools and libraries used include jQuery, Ace Editor, and Bootstrap.<br><br>
Overall, the "Code Editor" repository offers a valuable resource for developers and designers who want to build their own web-based code editors, and provides a range of features and tools to support code editing, sharing, and collaboration.
